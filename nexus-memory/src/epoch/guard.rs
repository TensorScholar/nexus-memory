//! Epoch Guard Implementation
//!
//! Guards provide RAII-based epoch pinning. While a guard exists, the thread
//! is considered active in the epoch, preventing garbage collection of data
//! that might be accessed through the guard.
//!
//! # Lifetime Safety
//!
//! The guard's lifetime is used to bound `Shared<'g, T>` pointers, ensuring
//! that shared references cannot outlive the protection window.
//!
//! # Memory Ordering
//!
//! Guards use SeqCst ordering for epoch updates to ensure proper synchronization
//! with the collector's epoch advancement logic.

/// A guard that pins the current thread in an epoch.
///
/// `Guard` is an RAII structure that represents a thread's participation in
/// the current epoch. While a guard exists, any data protected by epoch-based
/// reclamation is guaranteed to remain valid.
///
/// # Lifetime Bounds
///
/// The guard's lifetime `'_` bounds all `Shared<'_, T>` pointers created
/// through it, ensuring memory safety without runtime checks.
///
/// # Drop Behavior
///
/// When dropped, the guard decrements the pin count and potentially marks
/// the participant as inactive, allowing epoch advancement.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use nexus_memory::Collector;
///
/// let collector = Collector::new();
///
/// {
///     let guard = collector.pin();
///     // Protected region - data is safe to access
///     
///     // Guard dropped here, exiting the protected region
/// }
///
/// // Outside the protected region
/// ```
