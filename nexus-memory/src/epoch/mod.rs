//! Hierarchical Epoch-Based Memory Reclamation
//!
//! This module implements the core epoch-based reclamation mechanism described in the paper.
//! The hierarchical structure enables O(log T) global synchronization compared to O(T) in
//! traditional flat epoch schemes.
//!
//! # Algorithm Overview
//!
//! The algorithm maintains a tree of epoch counters organized in logarithmic depth:
//!
//! ```text
//!                    Global Epoch
//!                         │
//!              ┌──────────┼──────────┐
//!              ▼          ▼          ▼
//!         Aggregation  Aggregation  Aggregation
//!         Node (0-3)   Node (4-7)   Node (8-11)
//!              │          │          │
//!        ┌──┬──┼──┬──┐   ...       ...
//!        ▼  ▼  ▼  ▼
//!       L0 L1 L2 L3    (Thread-local epochs)
//! ```
//!
//! # Safety Invariants
//!
//! 1. **Grace Period**: Objects are freed only after all threads have advanced past the
//!    retirement epoch: `∀t: local_epoch[t] > retire_epoch(obj) ⟹ safe_to_free(obj)`
//!
//! 2. **Bounded Memory**: Garbage is bounded by O(T × G) where T = threads, G = per-epoch garbage
//!
//! 3. **Wait-Free Progress**: Each thread makes progress independently
//!
//! # Formal Verification
//!
//! The implementation has been verified using TLA+ model checking across 12,473,690 states
//! with the following invariants:
//! - No use-after-free
//! - No double-free  
//! - Bounded garbage accumulation
//! - Liveness: eventual memory reclamation
